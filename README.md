Codify CTF - Quickly stand-up CTF challenge environments

Quick sketch of how I imagine this working:

As a prototype I want to write a few Vagrantfile's defining what each challenge requires, when you run 'vagrant up' on that file the OS version, Software and CTF binary service should be running for you. I'm going to do a few of these and see if they're useful at all. Build from there.
